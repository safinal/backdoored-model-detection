## üîç Overview
This repository contains our solution for the Backdoored Model Detection Challenge, part of the [**Rayan International AI Contest**](https://ai.rayan.global). The challenge aims to develop a system that classifies models as either backdoored or clean.

## üéØ Challenge Objective
The goal is to build a robust system that can:

- **Process input consisting of:**
  - A machine learning **model** (specifically, a PreActResNet18 model trained on an image classification task)
  - The **number of classes** in the dataset
  - A **folder path to clean test images** (representing 1% of the test dataset)
  - The **image transformation** function used in model preprocessing

- **Identify and return** whether the provided model contains a backdoor, with output:
  - `0` if the model is **backdoored**
  - `1` if the model is **clean**

For more details, check the `problem_description.pdf` file.

## üß† Our Approach
Our approach leverages **activation-based optimization** and **statistical anomaly detection** to identify whether a given image classification model contains a backdoor. Here‚Äôs an overview of the method:

### 1. **Activation Inversion Optimization**

For each class in the dataset:

- We select a random batch of clean images and pass them through the first convolutional and residual layers of the model to obtain activations.
- Then, treating these activations as trainable variables, we **optimize them** (using the model‚Äôs latter layers held fixed) so that the final output is maximally confident towards a *chosen target class*.
- The process simulates searching for possible hidden triggers in the model‚Äôs representation that could elicit a strong, suspiciously focused output for any class.

### 2. **Maximal Confidence Statistic**

- For each class, we compute a **maximal confidence score**:  
  The model's maximum output (for the target class) after the activation inversion process, penalized for high outputs in other classes.
- This yields a **vector of scores**, one per class.

### 3. **Statistical Outlier Detection**

- If the model is clean, these maximal confidence values are usually balanced across all classes.
- A backdoored model, however, often contains one class whose maximal confidence is an **outlier** (because the backdoor trigger creates unusually high confidence for the target class).
- We fit an **exponential distribution** to the scores *excluding* the maximum. We then calculate the **p-value** of the actual maximum under this distribution to measure how extreme it is.
- If this p-value is below a set threshold (e.g., 0.08), the model is flagged as containing a backdoor.

### 4. **Key Features**

- **No dependence on knowledge of the specific trigger or attack type.**
- **Relies only on a small set of clean images and the model**‚Äîaligned with problem constraints.
- **Principled statistical decision**: robust against noise and overfitting.
